# Team chat that is open source and open standards

During our meetup we were not aware or were not able to remember any open source and open standards based team chat software/service, ie. similar to [Slack](http://slack.com) or [Stride (formerly HipChat)](https://stride.com/).

However it looks like there may be an open source (not sure if open standard) team chat software/service called [Riot (formerly Vector)](https://riot.im/)

We also mentioned some approaching:

* Movim https://movim.eu/ IM and social network, not really a team chat
* Mangosta iOS/Android but it is nowehere near ready, and won't be anytime soon https://github.com/esl/mangosta-ios https://github.com/esl/mangosta-android just code examples

In the non-XMPP open source world there is:

* Mattemost, Rocket.Chat, Let's Chat, Zulip, but specific protocol and not federated
* Ring, based on SIP, but using DHT and Blockchain

In the closed-source, proprietary world, there is:

* Cisco Spark
* Microsoft Teams
* Google Hangouts Chat
* Discord, initially for gamers, but becoming more widely used

As we could observe, the market craze is high about "Team Chat" or "Team Communications", sometimes coined "ChatOps".
