# Team chat that is open source and open standards

During our meetup we was not aware or was not able to remember any open source and open standards based team chat software/service, ie. similar to [Slack](http://slack.com) or [Stride (formerly HipChat)](https://stride.com/).

However it looks like there may be an open source (not sure if open standard) team chat software/service called [Riot (formerly Vector)](https://riot.im/)
