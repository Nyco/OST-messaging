# Open Source audio calls

We wanted to have a simple working solution for audio calls.

## XMPP
* Jitsi - https://jitsi.org/ technically superbe but the UI is quite aweful in Java

## SIP
* Ekiga - http://www.ekiga.org/ maybe a bit dead
* Ring - https://ring.cx/ growing fast, GUN project, mixing SIP+BHT+blockchain
* Wazo - http://wazo.community/ early stage, already usable, growing fast
