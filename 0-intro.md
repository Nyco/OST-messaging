On Wednesday September 20th, in Krakow, Poland, we gathered for a messaging meetup.


Here is how it was announced:

> Unconference, Open Space Technology on messaging/chat #OMGKRK
>
>During the first XMPP/Jabber meetup in May, some people discussed about having the next one in September. Here we go. On September 20th (Wednesday) at 17:00, we will host a collective intelligence session. We will organise an unconference, in the shape of an Open Space Technology.
>
>Please come in all shapes and sizes, and invite friends: developers, UX designers & researchers, founders, entrepreneurs, product manager/owners, even tourists!
>
>As we are all masters of chat and messaging apps, since we have (and have had) tens of the them in our pockets and our laptops for years, it would be wise to share experiences.
>
>We will meet to setup and introduce the conditions and rules of this Open Space Technology. Then we will all (each of us) propose subjects of discussions, that we will all vote on. The most popular items will be discussed in small groups. At the end, we will all meet again to synthetise and share all discussions.
>
>Very efficient way to share knowledge and experience with others. Highly exciting mean to meet people and learn from peers.
>
>Share within your networks!

We decided the subjects, and decided to make only one track.
